## ⚠️ Antivirus Warning (False Positive)

Since this application works by **manipulating the RAM (WriteProcessMemory)** of another process (the game), some Antivirus software might flag it as a threat or a "HackTool".

* **It is Safe:** This is standard behavior for Game Trainers. There is no malicious code.
* **Solution:** If the file gets deleted, please disable your Antivirus temporarily or add the trainer folder to your *Exclusion List*.

## ⚙️ Requirements
* OS: Windows 10 / 11
